    UpTick is iPhone daytrading application for Stocks and Forex.
    I joined UpTick team half-way. I have developed new features for JSON API
    (Rails 4.1, Grape), working closely with remote iOS team.
    I have implemented support for new financial data source, parallel
    chart data downloading, fast user geolocation and lot of other stuff.
    I have improved test coverage and made working with the code more comfortable.
    Application is heavily optimized using Postgres functions and triggers
    and memcached as a cache backend.
