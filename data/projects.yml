    UpTick is iPhone daytrading application for Stocks and Forex.
    I joined UpTick team half-way. I have developed new features for JSON API
    (Rails 4.1, Grape), working closely with remote iOS team.
    I have implemented support for new financial data source, parallel
    chart data downloading, fast user geolocation and lot of other stuff.
    I have improved test coverage and made working with the code more comfortable.
    Application is heavily optimized using Postgres functions and triggers
    and memcached as a cache backend.

    Ringpay started as Android application for small device-to-device payments.
    I have designed and developed complete JSON API (Rails 4.1) for mobile app.
    To limit battery drain, I preferred push notifications instead of polling when possible.
    Most challenging part was implementing symmetric-key encryption
    for all transaction requests, which made the app immune to HeartBleed-like attacks on SSL.

    SentenzeItalia is Italian law documents search engine and aggregator.
    It was a legacy-code project that I maintained and improved while working for MONK. I have cleaned and refactored code,
    improving its quality and preparing for work on version 2 of the app.
    I have implemented document scraping from various sources (HTML, DOC, PDF, XML, RTF),
    resulting in nearly 1 million of law documents available for search (and thousands of new every month).
    We have used Rails and ElasticSearch on the backend, and AngularJS
    on the frontend. The result is fast and responsive tool
    for searching, browsing and commenting on law documents.
    Version 2 is now during beta testing and will be available soon.
