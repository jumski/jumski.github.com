          UpTick is iPhone daytrading application for Stocks and Forex.
          I joined UpTick team half-way. I was developing new features for JSON API
          in Rails 4.1 and Grape working closely with remote iOS team.
          I have implemented support for new financial data source, parallel
          chart data downloading, user geolocation and lot of other stuff.
          I have improved test coverage and made working with the code more comfortable.
          Application is heavily optimized using Postgres functions and triggers
          and memcached as a cache backend.

          Ringpay started as Android application for small device-to-device payments.
          I have designed and developed complete JSON API (Rails 4.1) for mobile app.
          To limit battery drain, I preferred push notifications instead of polling when possible.
          Most challenging part was implementing symmetric-key encryption
          for all transaction requests, which made the app immune to HeartBleed-like attacks on SSL.

          SentenzeItalia is Italian law documents search engine and aggregator.
          It was a legacy-code project. I have cleaned and refactored code,
          improving its quality and preparing for work on version 2 of the app.
          I have implemented document scraping from various sources (HTML, DOC, PDF, XML, RTF),
          resulting in nearly 1 million of law documents available for search (and thousands of new every month).
          We have used Rails and ElasticSearch on the backend, and AngularJS
          on the frontend. The result is fast and responsive tool
          for searching, browsing and commenting on law documents.
          Version 2 is now during beta testing and will be available soon.

          Trov is mobile and desktop application for "collecting everything you own".
          I covered lot of existing code with tests, fixed lot of bugs
          and helped the team deliver final product on time.
          Frontend application was written with AngularJS and TypeScript.
          Backend used C# and ASP.NET. This was very interesting opportunity
          to get familiar with Microsoft web-application ecosystem.

          I have improved serveral legacy applications with smart refactorings

          I have developed new features for bluBase web application

          To improve process of shipping new code to production, I have set up
          Continuos Integration process.
          I simplified process of updating devices code by using git as an update protocol.

          I was a Senior Rails Developer in Akra team.

          best practices and improving overall coding culture in the team.

          (classified ads on map, pivoted to <a href="https://cleanagents.com/">CleanAgents</a>),
          ebookmakr (single-page Backbone applications for creating ebooks),

          I am very interested in functional programming (especially <a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a>).
          To learn a new language I have developed simple drums step sequencer using
          <a href="https://github.com/overtone/overtone">Overtone</a> (see the code: <a href="https://github.com/jumski/breakage">Breakage</a>).

          I work only in command line, using Tmux and VIM. To improve my work environment,
          and as an excercise with Test-First approach, I have developed
          <a href="https://github.com/jumski/tmux_status">TmuxStatus</a>,
          an object-oriented way to display information in Tmux status line.
          Code was test-driven using RSpec and designed around idea of segments (Composite design patter).
          I am using this tool all the time.

          I've made a Rails 3.x application for my girlfriend to help her
          put her books on Allegro.pl auction site.
          App manages 5000 auctions on Allegro.pl and pulls hundreds of
          transactions, payments and addresses monthly.
          I have integrated application with thermal printer to print stickers
          with addresses obtained from Allegro.pl, and added support for
          barcode scanner to lower time and cost needed to maintain
          a huge catalog of books.
          That have changed her hobby of selling books into full-blown business
          with nearly half thousand sold books per month today.
