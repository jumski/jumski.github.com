          I have implemented new financial data provider, parallel
          chart data downloading, lot of optimizations using Postgres functions and triggers,
          using memcached to cache what could be cached. Powered by clockwork and Sidekiq.
          Soon available in AppStore.

          I was developing Rails 4.1 JSON API for mobile app from scratch.
          Using PostgreSQL and Redis. Worked closely with remote Android developer.
          Most challenging part was implementing additional layer of symmetric-key encryption
          of all transaction requests (done as a Rack middleware).

          SentenzeItalia is Italian law documents search engine and aggregator.
          It was a legacy-code project that i have cleaned and refactored
          to deliver version 2 of the website.
          I have implemented document scraping from various sources (HTML, DOC, PDF, XML, RTF).
          We have used ElasticSearch as a search engine, and wrote an AngularJS
          single-page application to search and browse indexed documents.
          Version 2 is now during beta testing and will be available soon.
